# Hi, I'm Owen

I'm a quantitative researcher at [JLL](https://www.jll.com), based in London. 

In my professional work, I apply skills in data visualisation, geospatial analysis, automation and machine learning to generate insights, automate processes and create new products.

You can discover some of my recent projects at [ownkng.dev](https://ownkng.dev/).
